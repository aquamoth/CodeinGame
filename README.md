# CodeinGame
My implementations of some of the challanges from CodeinGame.com

I'm (of course) totally unaffiliated with codeingame.com. I'm a mere user who have fun completing their challanges.
You should check the site out for yourself!

For now, all code in here is in C#, but codeingame.com supports all variations of languages.

Feel free to look at or code any part of the code you find useful. 
Bare in mind the code is pretty ugly since the target is to pass tests, not to write readable and "sane" code (which should really be your main target in real life..)
